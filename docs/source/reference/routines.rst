CUB/cuTENSOR backend for reduction routines
-------------------------------------------
Some CuPy reduction routines, including :func:`~cupy.sum`, :func:`~cupy.amin`, :func:`~cupy.amax`,
:func:`~cupy.argmin`, :func:`~cupy.argmax`, and other functions built on top of them, can be
accelerated by switching to the `CUB`_ or `cuTENSOR`_ backend. These backends can be enabled
by setting ``CUPY_ACCELERATORS`` environement variable as documented :ref:`here<environment>`.
Note that while in general the accelerated reductions are faster, there could be exceptions
depending on the data layout. We recommend users to perform some benchmarks to determine
whether CUB/cuTENSOR offers better performance or not.
